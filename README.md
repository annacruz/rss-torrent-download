RSS Torrent Download (RTD, for short) is a group of scripts aimed to fetch an RSS and download torrent files attached to them based on regular expressions.

All torrents can be saved on a specified folder, where your client can check for news files to download.

Usage Instructions

First install python-pip

In Mac:

`easy_install pip`

In Linux/Ubuntu:

`sudo apt-get install python-pip`

After that, just use de requirements file to install dependencies

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

**IMPORTANT**
-------------

This script is in an early alpha release, so don't expect so much in the next releases. As the project became usable, i'll update this readme with more useful usage instructions.
